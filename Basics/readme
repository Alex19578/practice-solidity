Solidity Basics

This repository contains 40 Solidity programs that cover various fundamental concepts of the Solidity programming language. Each program is stored as a separate file, numbered from 01 to 40. Below is a list of the files and their descriptions:
01_FirstContract.sol
Description:

Introduces the basic structure of a Solidity contract and demonstrates a simple contract creation and execution.
02_ValueTypes.sol
Description:

Illustrates the usage of value types in Solidity, including integers, booleans, addresses, and strings.
03_FunctionsIntro.sol
Description:

Provides an introduction to functions in Solidity and demonstrates their usage within a contract.
04_Variables.sol
Description:

Covers different types of variables in Solidity, including local variables, function parameters, and state variables.
05_GlobalVariables.sol
Description:

Explores the usage of global variables such as msg.sender, msg.value, and block.timestamp in Solidity.
06_StateMutabilityFunctions.sol
Description:

Explains the concept of state mutability in Solidity and introduces the view, pure, payable, and default mutability.
07_ConstantAndImmutableVariables.sol
Description:

Demonstrates the usage of constant and immutable variables in Solidity.
08_Conditions.sol
Description:

Illustrates conditional statements (if-else) and their usage in Solidity contracts.
09_Loops.sol
Description:

Covers different types of loops (for, while, and do-while) in Solidity and their applications.
10_ErrorHandling.sol
Description:

Introduces error handling in Solidity using require, assert, and revert statements.
11_FunctionModifiers.sol
Description:

Explains function modifiers and how they can be used to modify the behavior of functions.
12_Constructor.sol
