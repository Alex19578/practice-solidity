## 19_DataLocation.sol
Explains the different data locations (`memory`, `storage`, and `calldata`) in Solidity and their implications.

## 20_Events.sol
Illustrates the usage of events in Solidity for emitting logs and notifying external applications.

## 21_SingleInheritance.sol
Demonstrates the concept of single inheritance in Solidity, where a contract inherits from a single base contract.

## 25_CallParentConstructor.sol
Demonstrates how to call the constructor of a parent contract during contract inheritance in Solidity.

## 26_VisibilitySpecifiers.sol
Explains the

 visibility specifiers (`public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external`) in Solidity and their implications.

## 27_CallParentFunction.sol
Illustrates how to call functions from a parent contract in Solidity.

## 28_ThisKeyword.sol

## 29_Payable.sol
Introduces the `payable` keyword in Solidity and demonstrates how to receive and handle Ether within a contract.

## 30_SpecialFunctions.sol
Explains special functions in Solidity, such as the fallback function, receive function, and selfdestruct function.

## 31_SendEther.sol
Illustrates how to send Ether from one contract to another in Solidity.
